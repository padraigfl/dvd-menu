# TODO list

(will probably never happen)

- resolve nav issues when using route other than '/' from webpack
- resolve mobile media query issues
- test on an android device
- remove all custom stuff into jsons
- strip youtube coupling (it'd actually work far better from direct mp4s)
- add some gimmickry for the settings (e.g. directors commentary displays comments included in json or something)
- give video a frame to look nicer
- prevent play starting at 0
- resolve annoying pause issues
- resolve video src swapping bugs (e.g. not redirecting on finish, not autoplaying on route change)
- improve initial launch (make it easy to force in all that bullshit you had to sit through at the start of a dvd)
- routing is buggy, need to use '/' starting point always
