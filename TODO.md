# TODO list

(will probably never happen)

- test on an android device
- remove all custom stuff into jsons
- strip youtube coupling (it'd actually work far better from direct mp4s)
- add some gimmickry for the settings (e.g. directors commentary displays comments included in json or something)
- resolve annoying pause issues (currently loops frames)
- resolve video src swapping bugs (e.g. not redirecting on finish, not autoplaying on route change)
- improve initial launch (make it easy to force in all that bullshit you had to sit through at the start of a dvd)
- routing is buggy, need to use '/' starting point always
- youtube videojs playsinline=true should be playsinline=1, not sure of issues beyond this as it seems to break othr things
